Nextion Display Layout for NextionDriver
========================================

The NextionDriver introduces some supplementary fields for linux hosts
(as most hotspots are)

It is advisable to switch to layout 4, setting your display baudrate to 115200bps
If not, screen updates will be rather slow...

I know, the example display in this directory is not a nice, beautiful layout.
It is a basic layout to show the possibilities.
Making something nice of it is your job ;-)


Fields (and their numbers) on the pages, used by NextionDriver
--------------------------------------------------------------

After executing a linux command, (2A F0 or 2A F1) status code 25 
will be sent.


MMDVM
t20 : CPU temp
t21 : CPU freq
t22 : system load
t23 : %disk free
cpuload : integer value of the system load in %
t30 : Hotspot RX frequency (from MMDVM.ini)
t31 : Hotspot location (from MMDVM.ini)
t32 : Hotspot TX frequency (from MMDVM.ini)
(Note : these are now sent by MMDVMHost)

A* and N* when showModeStatus is active

status code 24 will be sent once after sending these values




DMR
t8 : TG name

t13: user data field 1
t14: user data field 2
t15: user data field 3
t16: user data field 4
